 * DefaultMarsController is the default implementation for the MarsController interface.
 * The controller shouldn't even know that it is used in an API context..
 *
 * This class and all other classes in the logic-package (or future sub-packages)
 * should use 100% plain old Java Objects (POJOs). The use of Json, JsonObject or
 * Strings that contain encoded/json data should be avoided here.
 * Keep libraries and frameworks out of the logic packages as much as possible.
 * Do not be afraid to create your own Java classes if needed.
