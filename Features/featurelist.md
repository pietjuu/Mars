    => Idea: if the door is closed and the sensors confirms that => Send dummy data to to the server and “calculate” a price/atom  
### Must Have  
- Vacuum enclosure  
- Module to scan an item on a molecular level (create digital footprint of item)  
- Module to convert an item into separate molecules.  
- Module to convert molecules into an item.  
- Module to receive/send molecules over a pipeline.  
- Sensor to know when the enclosure door is closed.  
- Emergency button  
### Should Have  
- Interface to display information about the item  

## TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE  
Infrastructure/network to connect transporters together  
### Must Have  
- Molecule pipelines  
- Amplifiers  
- Molecule routers/switches
